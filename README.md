This e-commerce website for mobile phones is developed using Java Servlets and JSP for the frontend and backend, with MySQL as the database. It offers complete CRUD operations allowing users to register, update profiles, and manage their accounts, while admins can add, update, view, and delete mobile phone products. Customers can browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and place orders, with order details stored and managed in the database. The system supports secure order processing and payment handling. An admin panel provides control over product listings, user accounts, and order management, making the platform fully functional and easy to maintain.
